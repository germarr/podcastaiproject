ABOUT THE THREE QUESTIONS WITH ANDY RICHTER
Host Andy Richter asks the same three questions to each guest: Where do you come from? Where are you going? What have you learned? These three simple questions, when answered honestly and thoughtfully, are enough to provide a pretty complete picture of who a person is. The answers are what Andy always wants to know about people. This will not be a one-sided process, as Andy won’t shy away from getting personal himself.

ABOUT WHERE EVERYBODY KNOWS YOUR NAME 
Ted Danson and Woody Harrelson are total opposites with an unbreakable bond since meeting on the hit sitcom “Cheers.” But after that show wrapped, life took them in different directions, and they missed each other. This podcast is a chance to reconnect, both with each other and the amazing friends they’ve each met over the decades, like Will Arnett, Dax Shepard, Jane Fonda, Mary Steenburgen, José Andrés, Conan O'Brien, and more - that is, when Ted can get a hold of Woody! Join them as they dig beyond the career highlights and into the stuff of life that makes us who we are. Like the title says, this is a place to be known.

ABOUT WHERE EVERYBODY KNOWS YOUR NAME 
Ted Danson and Woody Harrelson are total opposites with an unbreakable bond since meeting on the hit sitcom “Cheers.” But after that show wrapped, life took them in different directions, and they missed each other. This podcast is a chance to reconnect, both with each other and the amazing friends they’ve each met over the decades, like Will Arnett, Dax Shepard, Jane Fonda, Mary Steenburgen, José Andrés, Conan O'Brien, and more - that is, when Ted can get a hold of Woody! Join them as they dig beyond the career highlights and into the stuff of life that makes us who we are. Like the title says, this is a place to be known.

ABOUT WHERE EVERYBODY KNOWS YOUR NAME 
Ted Danson and Woody Harrelson are total opposites with an unbreakable bond since meeting on the hit sitcom “Cheers.” But after that show wrapped, life took them in different directions, and they missed each other. This podcast is a chance to reconnect, both with each other and the amazing friends they’ve each met over the decades, like Will Arnett, Dax Shepard, Jane Fonda, Mary Steenburgen, José Andrés, Conan O'Brien, and more - that is, when Ted can get a hold of Woody! Join them as they dig beyond the career highlights and into the stuff of life that makes us who we are. Like the title says, this is a place to be known.

ABOUT WHERE EVERYBODY KNOWS YOUR NAME 
Ted Danson and Woody Harrelson are total opposites with an unbreakable bond since meeting on the hit sitcom “Cheers.” But after that show wrapped, life took them in different directions, and they missed each other. This podcast is a chance to reconnect, both with each other and the amazing friends they’ve each met over the decades, like Will Arnett, Dax Shepard, Jane Fonda, Mary Steenburgen, José Andrés, Conan O'Brien, and more - that is, when Ted can get a hold of Woody! Join them as they dig beyond the career highlights and into the stuff of life that makes us who we are. Like the title says, this is a place to be known.
